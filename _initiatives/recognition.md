Through CRP, we provide students and alumni the rare opportunity to recognize their peers, mentors, and whomever you appreciate within the UBC Sauder Co-op network. This is a platform for you to be recognized for your generous help and impact on others. 

We are always committed to building a sense of community for all Sauder Co-op students and alumni. The establishment of this Co-op Recognition Program (CRP) is initiated by COSAS.

### Who can participate?

Any individual who has benefitted from a member of the UBC Sauder Co-op Community can show their appreciation by giving a shout-out through the recognition program. You can recognize any UBC Sauder alum, Co-op mentor, or fellow student for providing assistance, support, or advice!
