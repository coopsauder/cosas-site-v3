The Co-op Recognition Program (CRP) provides students with the rare opportunity to publicly recognize – and be recognized – for their impact and contributions to the UBC Sauder Co-op program. 

[We are always committed to building a sense of community for all Sauder Co-op students and alumni.]({{ site.baseurl }}/static_files/other/RecognitionLetter.pdf)

### How CRP works:

1. There’s an individual you wish to recognize. [*Note: A genuine reason for appreciation must be provided*]
2. [**Submit the Recognition Form**](https://forms.gle/TkJAZDpYwSYz9vvL6)
3. COSAS will send your message to the recognized individual(s). With permission, COSAS will feature outstanding notes on various social media platforms biweekly. [*Anonymous notes of thanks also accepted*].

###  Why CRP?
1. Individuals can publicly express their appreciation to those that made a positive impact on their Co-op journey. 
2. Appreciation can be given anonymously.
3. High contributing members will be awarded at the end of semester.
   
### Who can participate?
Any individual in the UBC Sauder Co-op network has the opportunity to participate in CRP!
