      Hi everyone! My name is Yewen, and I am in my third year at Sauder with a finance specialization. This summer, I worked at Robert H. Lee Graduate School as a recruitment & admission assistant. I’ll be starting my first Co-op term at WorkSafeBC’s Corporate Finance Department in September.  In my free time, I like playing the piano and dancing Latin! Last year, I received help and sharing from COSAS as an applicant; this year, I hope to work alongside my lovely teammates, creating an interactive and meaningful environment for Co-op fellows.

      Hi everyone! I'm so excited to be part of the 2020-2021 COSAS team. As VP Initiatives, I will be working closely with our amazing initiatives team to deliver on some pretty awesome events. 
      My specialization is a Combined Major in Business and Computer Science. Like many of us in this specialization, there are so many options to take our skills and education. 
      One of the biggest reasons I joined Co-op was for the extra guidance and support in finding where I want to take my career.
      I've also had the amazing opportunity to kick-start COSAS's new website (this one). If there are any issues/suggestions/comments, please reach out to me. 
    hobbies: Ultimate Frisbee; Anything developer related
    fact: I almost got crushed by an industrial sized pressure fryer at KFC.

      I wanted to give back to my Co-op community and also meet more people outside of my regular social circles. COSAS was the perfect outlet for me to do so!
      The environment is so accepting and we are given a lot of freedom to work with the Co-op Team to provide new support and outreach to Co-op students.
