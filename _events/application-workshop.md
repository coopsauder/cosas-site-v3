COSAS is excited to offer a new Co-op Intake Application Workshop for the academic year 2020-2021. The purpose of the application clinic is to assist potential incoming Co-op students through the process and answer any application-related questions they have. The session will focus on key elements of the Co-op Application Process, tips for making your application stand out, and suggestions for resumes. 

**Our first workshop will be on September 8th and pending demand, more will follow so make sure to check our social media for new updates!**
